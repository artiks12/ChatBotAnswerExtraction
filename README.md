# ChatBotAnswerExtraction
This is the repository to extract answers from ChatBots. It is a part of the master thesis "Evaluation and Adaptation of Large Language Models for Question-Answering on Legislation" made in University of Latvia.

### How to Use
First you need to save ChatBot responses as HTML files. It is necessary to save all responses from a single chatbot in a separate folder that is located in "ChatBotAnswers" folder. You also need to populate the template.json folder with necessary question-answer data.
Once both things are done, you can run the getChatbotResponses.py script and all chatbot repsonses will be saved in ModelResponses folder.
